# &#9660; AntiStrap
&#9661; Antistrap is a markdown superset made for writing longscroll information websites quickly and without knowledge of design.

Guess what it's in the middle of heavy dev/restructuring and is totally unusable right now so don't try please. Check back with the repo sometime in the next few weeks if you're interested in working with it in the future.
